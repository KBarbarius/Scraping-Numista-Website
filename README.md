# Scraping-Numista-Website
The aim of this project was to collect coin information from Numista Website.
I used ScrapeOpps to randomise the fake browsers headers and user agents.
Additionally I used rotating proxies for by pass website robot.txt.
At the end I was able to scrape over 200,000 rows of data.
