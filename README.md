# Scraping-Numista-Website
The aim of this project was to collect coin information from Numista Website.
It was a challenges as the website had robot.txt monitoring the numbers of requests.
To tame this challenge I used ScrapeOpps to randomise the fake browsers headers and user agents.
Additionally I used rotating proxies.
At the end I was able to scrape over 10,000 rows of data.
